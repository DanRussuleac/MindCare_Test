# MindCare_test
 
This is my Testing/Creation of my app Mindcare - will create a final repo once the app is done - this is for debugging and evaluation of the development.

Name: ???

Work done so far:

Have completed my overall idea of the project, planning has begun yet moreso working on the nitty gritty of setup before planning all the small details - chatbot setup(wasn't even sure if this would be possible for me), setup a welcome page - login page - must setup a database of the time of this commit - get persistance and session auth throughout the application - setup my homepage and then my other side tasks (journal/daily tasks/mental recap etc)

Next to do: Database setup/Login logic backend
